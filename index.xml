Do YOU want to spice up your online messaging style??? Well you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place! Here are some tips to make people think you&amp;rsquo;re friggin out of your mind:
RAnDom CapiTALiZatIon Useful when mocking something or just wanting to sound very over-the-top for any reason. Capitalization can also indicate where you&amp;rsquo;d normally change your tone/pitch to emphasize things.

A habit I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into recently is sending the original URLs of images instead of copy + pasting them to friends. The rationale behind this is to avoid unnecessary redundancy. For every image that gets copy + pasted onto some messaging platform, the user is effectively uploading a new file to the server (and probably for free).</description></item><item><title>Four Years of osu!

It had no structure, poor rhythm choices, and fairly garbage-tier aesthetics. But I kept mapping anyway, and I like to think that I got a little better making beatmaps since. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent so much time on this game, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d document my journey and some of the things I learned over these past 4 years as a tribute of sorts to that beatmap.</description></item><item><title>An Adventure in Building osulist</title><link>http://example.org/posts/an-adventure-in-building-osulist/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 14:23:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/an-adventure-in-building-osulist/</guid><description>https://osulist.tk/
One of my favorite computer games is osu! (exclamation mark included) It&amp;rsquo;s a free rhythm game where the player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to click a bunch of circles that appear on the screen to the beat of a song. Songs are referred to as &amp;ldquo;beatmaps,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; for short.
Over time, something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a really great way to share multiple beatmaps with your friends. Say you&amp;rsquo;ve found a few beatmaps that you really like, and you want your friend to try playing them.</description></item><item><title>Getting Back Into Blogging</title><link>http://example.org/posts/getting-back-into-blogging/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 20:48:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/getting-back-into-blogging/</guid><description>Back in early 2016, I created a Tumblr account because God knows why. Aha, actually it&amp;rsquo;s because I sorta wanted to exercise my writing skills somewhere outside of school, and blogging seemed like a cool way to achieve that. Part of me actually enjoyed writing because it was a nice way to sort out some thoughts in my head, and overall, it was just a peaceful experience.
At the time, I thought my posts were pretty cool.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Design</title><link>http://example.org/posts/thoughts-on-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 20:48:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/thoughts-on-design/</guid><description>Many of my friends are well-invested into various forms of arts, either as hobbyists or professionals. So I hear a lot about the zeitgeist™ of whatever art communities are relevant at the time. As a result, I also start thinking more about art and its value (but usually it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more significant than &amp;ldquo;wohaoh this art looks very cool&amp;rdquo;).
Someone I know, being a part-time UI designer, spread their interest in graphic design over to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
