Sometime during 2am, my friend and roommate Mia told us that it looked friggin crazy outside. I guess she saw some fog outside her bedroom window? In any case, she ran out with her camera, and so obviously I had to run out with my own camera as well.
The atmosphere was chilly and misty. The droplets of mist lingering in the air diffused the amber glow from the streetlights around us.</description></item><item><title>Stearns Wharf</title><link>/gallery/stearns-wharf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 18:09:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/stearns-wharf/</guid><description>I never grew up around the ocean, but sometimes I feel like I was a fisherman in a past life. I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that one of the most blissful feelings to ever experience is the sensation of the ocean breeze flowing past your face as you smell the salty air and listen to the waves gently crash over and over again. I think I could sit on this pier and just look out into the distance for a while without having any thoughts cross my mind.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9225</title><link>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 18:15:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF8801</title><link>/gallery/corner-store/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 12:18:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/corner-store/</guid><description>For 2 months during the summer this photo was taken, I worked full-time at a grocery store! It was a goal of mine for quite a while to experience working a job that isn&amp;rsquo;t just software engineering, where I sit in the same desk in front of the same computer screen and talk to the same people every day1, and so when I finally had an off-term from school, I was super stoked to try new things.</description></item><item><title>DSCF8644</title><link>/gallery/monopoly-deal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 16:59:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/monopoly-deal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Slow Down</title><link>/gallery/slow-down/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 19:46:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/slow-down/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7817</title><link>/gallery/cosmo-clock/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:41:55 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cosmo-clock/</guid><description>This photo was taken sometime during golden hour on Yokohama&amp;rsquo;s (world famous?) Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn&amp;rsquo;t completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds.</description></item><item><title>Ludibrium</title><link>/gallery/ludibrium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:20:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ludibrium/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Step Right Up</title><link>/gallery/step-right-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 21:07:12 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/step-right-up/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7117</title><link>/gallery/kimonos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 17:49:03 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/kimonos/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF6744</title><link>/gallery/station-kimono/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 19:34:37 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/station-kimono/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Playground</title><link>/gallery/playground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 01:15:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/playground/</guid><description>Part 3 of 3 Part 2
Uhhhhh I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what to talk about here. I found this playground that looked somewhat creepy in the dead of the night. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll flesh out this part some other time XDDD</description></item><item><title>Ominous Alley</title><link>/gallery/ominous-alley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:32:07 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ominous-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Street in Kagurazaka</title><link>/gallery/street-in-kagurazaka/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:31:26 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/street-in-kagurazaka/</guid><description>Part 2 of 3 Part 1
The streets were so utterly silent and empty. I guess having gotten used to living in Ginza, being in a relatively more suburban community felt so off-putting because there were next to no sounds at all. And you&amp;rsquo;d think that in a metropolitan region as dense as Tokyo, SURELY there&amp;rsquo;d always be something happening somewhere right? Well I guess my brain is probably just deep fried from too much pop culture or media or whatever.</description></item><item><title>Nice Comfy Hotel</title><link>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:21:25 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</guid><description>Part 1 of 3 Jasmine and her friends arrived in Japan 1 day after I had to move out of my Ginza apartment. This left me with one day in-between to find some temporary accommodation. I elected to try staying in one of those mystical CAPSULE HOTELS that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so much about on social media.
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen photos of them, a capsule hotel is essentially just an accommodation where instead of renting out rooms or suites for the night, you rent out a small rectangular prism of space inside a wall that has nothing more than a twin-sized futon and probably a few hooks for your coats.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5840</title><link>/gallery/sakura-kei/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:55 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakura-kei/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5839</title><link>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:23 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</guid><description>This place gets reaaaaaal busy during Hanami, and understandably so. I came here on multiple different occasions just to take pictures of the cherry blossoms because yeah I&amp;rsquo;m basic like that.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I made sure to get lots of random things in this picture to make it unique, and I also tuned up the saturation way past what they actually look like in real life. Rest assured, Naka-Meguro is still a very pretty place in person even if your eyeballs don&amp;rsquo;t have the latest saturation-boosting mods installed.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5755</title><link>/gallery/sakurain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:07:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakurain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hong Kong Alley</title><link>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:12:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Taiwanese Alley</title><link>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:10:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5603</title><link>/gallery/chinatown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 20:40:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/chinatown/</guid><description>Usually you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&amp;rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that lively.</description></item><item><title>Tsukiji Motorcycle</title><link>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:32:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lanterns</title><link>/gallery/lanterns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:23:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/lanterns/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5446</title><link>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:22:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Delivery</title><link>/gallery/delivery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:20:57 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/delivery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5431</title><link>/gallery/the-director/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:15:54 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/the-director/</guid><description>This photo was taken from up on top of a little bridge connecting two buildings in the Tsukiji Outer Market. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how intentional this photo was, but I think the traffic director looks super cool in this composition.
I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people working as these types of traffic control officers in Japan. They work late into the nights guarding building garage entrances too. It must get kinda cold doing that type of job late at night.</description></item><item><title>Train Cabin</title><link>/gallery/train-cabin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:07:38 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/train-cabin/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5198</title><link>/gallery/listless-dream/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:05:38 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/listless-dream/</guid><description>This photo was taken while I was riding the Tobu-Nikko line, somewhere in the middle of Saitama City. It&amp;rsquo;s got such a dreamy, liminal quality it has from the blurred subjects and overexposed whites with a little bit of the cold blue sky still present. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken that really evokes emotion in me whenever I see it. What emotion that is, I really do not know how to describe.</description></item><item><title>Drugstore</title><link>/gallery/drugstore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 10:40:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/drugstore/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hot Dog Stand</title><link>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 19:24:50 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</guid><description>I was trying to get one of those really cool urban neon-Tokyo vibes shots of a man chilling at a food stall underneath neon lights. I think my composition kinda sucked though because I felt quite self-conscious about photographing strangers, which may or may not be a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make my photos have a more human and present feeling to them though.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5070</title><link>/gallery/red-bike/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 20:59:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-bike/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Downtown Akihabara Street</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-street/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 13:18:46 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-street/</guid><description>On Sunday afternoons, the main street of Akihabara is closed off to vehicles, allowing pedestrians to freely roam the streets! It&amp;rsquo;s quite the liberating feeling, being able to just walk into the middle of the road without running the risk of dying to a car! Especially in a city built as dense as Tokyo, it&amp;rsquo;s a very welcome breather to have.
I took this photo on the day after Mia arrived in Japan.</description></item><item><title>Akihabara Overblown</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 12:03:59 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</guid><description>I process most of my images through Filmulator. While playing around with the settings, I found a way to really make the image look a bit deep fried and oversaturated, blasted with colours that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually see in real life. This is one of my photographs which met such a demise. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fitting though, given how colorful Akihabara actually still is, despite not necessarily being &amp;ldquo;deep fried&amp;rdquo; irl.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4626</title><link>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 11:57:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</guid><description>Just a cool a little alley I stumbled across.

It&amp;rsquo;s got that super down-to-earth cheap wooden tables and plastic chairs vibe all about, where people can yap about their lives and stuff while chowing down chicken skewers and beer. The entire street glows with a comfy amber aura throughout the evening while customers come and go.
The first time I came here, I vowed to never eat at any of the restaurants until my girlfriend would eventually come visit in Japan 7 months later.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4271</title><link>/gallery/shibuya-signs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 19:48:03 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/shibuya-signs/</guid><description>Everyone with a camera has to take one those token Shibuya-Neon-Lights-City-That-Never-Sleeps type photographs when they visit Japan right? Well, here&amp;rsquo;s one!
This was taken on my first night ever checking out Shibuya. Despite already having seen tons of these types of photos online before moving to Tokyo, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare to actually standing right in the middle of the visual and audial cacophony in-person. Seeing all the lights and signs which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand felt magical.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4185</title><link>/gallery/trainyard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:50:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/trainyard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Phonebooth</title><link>/gallery/phonebooth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 11:00:31 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/phonebooth/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Skeleton</title><link>/gallery/skeleton/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 02:28:16 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/skeleton/</guid><description>I took this photo on a random day where I decided to take a 6-hour walk.

The decisions I made affected no one else but me.</description></item><item><title>NOW PLAYING</title><link>/gallery/now-playing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:58:10 +0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/now-playing/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s this really cool retro-style pink-coloured snack bar inside the theatre with neon signs and cool popcorn machines and one of those signs with blocky letters that you attach to pegholes and anyways it was just a very nice vibe.
I asked the guy working there if it was alright to take a photo of him working there because I thought of this whole composition in my mind where it&amp;rsquo;s some dude doing his local small cinema tasks next to the popcorn machine and the candy jars and anyways he said &amp;ldquo;No.</description></item><item><title>GULF OF GEORGIA CANNERY</title><link>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:22:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</guid><description>Just a shot of a building I saw at the Steveston Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf.

The line did not lie, the ramen was worth lining up for. I got some spicy ramen that my stomach didn&amp;rsquo;t end up quite agreeing with, but it was still an enjoyable experience! I think?</description></item></channel></rss>
