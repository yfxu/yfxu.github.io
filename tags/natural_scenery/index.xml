Japan celebrates a statutory holiday called &amp;ldquo;Sports Day&amp;rdquo; every year. It&amp;rsquo;s a day dedicated to the pursuit of health and longevity through physical activities and general healthy lifestyle choices.
To celebrate this day, I joined a few of my fellow co-op student friends on a day trip to hike Mount Takao, or &amp;ldquo;Takaosan,&amp;rdquo; as the Japanese name would be romanized. Mount Takao is relatively accessible from central Tokyo, with a single train line travelling from Shinjuku Station all the way to the foot of Mount Takao.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4450</title><link>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:14:04 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some cool mysterious stairs we saw from when I hiked Mount Takao with some friends. There were an awful lot of stairs on this mountain hike. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it made things easier or worse to be honest.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4447</title><link>/gallery/eerie-path/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:10:25 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/eerie-path/</guid><description>This was another shot I took during my ascent of Takaosan with some co-op friends in Japan. The thick fog is really cool for producing strange, eerie photos.</description></item><item><title>DSCF3851</title><link>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:53:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Long Way Back</title><link>/gallery/long-way-back/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 11:52:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/long-way-back/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made the drive between Calgary and Vancouver quite a few times now. It always sounds pretty daunting before the journey begins because it&amp;rsquo;s a whole flippin&amp;rsquo; 10 hour drive!!! But once we&amp;rsquo;re actually on the road it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad. You get to just enter a zen flow state and watch the trees pass by, mountains change their shapes, and the sky get darker and darker&amp;hellip; ok maybe that part isn&amp;rsquo;t as cool.</description></item><item><title>Cool Rock I Found</title><link>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 15:50:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</guid><description>I found this rock existing in its natural state.
