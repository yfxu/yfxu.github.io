I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that one of the most blissful feelings to ever experience is the sensation of the ocean breeze flowing past your face as you smell the salty air and listen to the waves gently crash over and over again. I think I could sit on this pier and just look out into the distance for a while without having any thoughts cross my mind.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9400</title><link>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 17:32:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</guid><description>Honestly this is kinda just a filler photo to put in the gallery to make myself seem more well-travelled ! aHA !
This photo was taken on a short trip with my girlfriend when we visited her Dad in Los Angeles. We spent 2 days in Santa Barbara, and it was the first time in many years that I&amp;rsquo;d been to a token California beach.
It was hot and humid, and neither my girlfriend nor I were able to think with more than six combined brain cells because we were both physically and mentally melting in real life!</description></item><item><title>Ruby</title><link>/gallery/ruby/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 13:46:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ruby/</guid><description>Long exposure photography is pretty brainlessly fun! You just kinda hold down the shutter button and wave the camera around like your in-game sensitivity is on 10.0x, and then release and look at the cool little pattern you get!
This one was taken inside the Chihuly Glass Museum, specifically inside this one room where the entire ceiling was full of various coloured glass sculptures with warm light filtering through it.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9225</title><link>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 18:15:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
