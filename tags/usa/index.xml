I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that one of the most blissful feelings to ever experience is the sensation of the ocean breeze flowing past your face as you smell the salty air and listen to the waves gently crash over and over again. I think I could sit on this pier and just look out into the distance for a while without having any thoughts cross my mind.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9400</title><link>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 17:32:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</guid><description>Honestly this is kinda just a filler photo to put in the gallery to make myself seem more well-travelled ! aHA !
This photo was taken on a short trip with my girlfriend when we visited her Dad in Los Angeles. We spent 2 days in Santa Barbara, and it was the first time in many years that I&amp;rsquo;d been to a token California beach.
It was hot and humid, and neither my girlfriend nor I were able to think with more than six combined brain cells because we were both physically and mentally melting in real life!</description></item></channel></rss>
