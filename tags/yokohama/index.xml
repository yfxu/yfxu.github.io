Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn&amp;rsquo;t completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds.</description></item><item><title>Ludibrium</title><link>/gallery/ludibrium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:20:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ludibrium/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hong Kong Alley</title><link>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:12:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Taiwanese Alley</title><link>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:10:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5603</title><link>/gallery/chinatown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 20:40:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/chinatown/</guid><description>Usually you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&amp;rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that lively.</description></item></channel></rss>
