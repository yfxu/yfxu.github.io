I came here on multiple different occasions just to take pictures of the cherry blossoms because yeah I&amp;rsquo;m basic like that.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I made sure to get lots of random things in this picture to make it unique, and I also tuned up the saturation way past what they actually look like in real life. Rest assured, Naka-Meguro is still a very pretty place in person even if your eyeballs don&amp;rsquo;t have the latest saturation-boosting mods installed.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5755</title><link>/gallery/sakurain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:07:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakurain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5603</title><link>/gallery/chinatown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 20:40:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/chinatown/</guid><description>Usually you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&amp;rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that lively.</description></item><item><title>Delivery</title><link>/gallery/delivery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:20:57 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/delivery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5431</title><link>/gallery/the-director/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:15:54 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/the-director/</guid><description>This photo was taken from up on top of a little bridge connecting two buildings in the Tsukiji Outer Market. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how intentional this photo was, but I think the traffic director looks super cool in this composition.
I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people working as these types of traffic control officers in Japan. They work late into the nights guarding building garage entrances too. It must get kinda cold doing that type of job late at night.</description></item><item><title>Hot Dog Stand</title><link>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 06:46:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</guid><description>I was trying to get one of those really cool urban neon-Tokyo vibes shots of a man chilling at a food stall underneath neon lights. I think my composition kinda sucked though because I felt quite self-conscious about photographing strangers, which may or may not be a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make my photos have a more human and present feeling to them though.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5198</title><link>/gallery/listless-dream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 13:05:38 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/listless-dream/</guid><description>This photo was taken while I was riding the Tobu-Nikko line, somewhere in the middle of Saitama City. It&amp;rsquo;s got such a dreamy, liminal quality it has from the blurred subjects and overexposed whites with a little bit of the cold blue sky still present. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken that really evokes emotion in me whenever I see it. What emotion that is, I really do not know how to describe.</description></item><item><title>Akihabara Overblown</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 12:03:59 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</guid><description>I process most of my images through Filmulator. While playing around with the settings, I found a way to really make the image look a bit deep fried and oversaturated, blasted with colours that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually see in real life. This is one of my photographs which met such a demise. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fitting though, given how colorful Akihabara actually still is, despite not necessarily being &amp;ldquo;deep fried&amp;rdquo; irl.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4626</title><link>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 23:19:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</guid><description>Just a cool a little alley I stumbled across.

It&amp;rsquo;s got that super down-to-earth cheap wooden tables and plastic chairs vibe all about, where people can yap about their lives and stuff while chowing down chicken skewers and beer. The entire street glows with a comfy amber aura throughout the evening while customers come and go.
The first time I came here, I vowed to never eat at any of the restaurants until my girlfriend would eventually come visit in Japan 7 months later.</description></item></channel></rss>
