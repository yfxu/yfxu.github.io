This photo was taken on a short trip with my girlfriend when we visited her Dad in Los Angeles. We spent 2 days in Santa Barbara, and it was the first time in many years that I&amp;rsquo;d been to a token California beach.
It was hot and humid, and neither my girlfriend nor I were able to think with more than six combined brain cells because we were both physically and mentally melting in real life!</description></item><item><title>DSCF7817</title><link>/gallery/cosmo-clock/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:41:55 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cosmo-clock/</guid><description>This photo was taken sometime during golden hour on Yokohama&amp;rsquo;s (world famous?) Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn&amp;rsquo;t completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds.</description></item><item><title>DSCF6123</title><link>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 16:37:24 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF4185</title><link>/gallery/trainyard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:50:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/trainyard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF3851</title><link>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:53:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</guid><description/></item><item><title>20220417_162453</title><link>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 16:24:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</guid><description>The bridge was very green and the sky was very blue so I was like &amp;ldquo;mmm yes cool shot&amp;rdquo; and then I took the photo.</description></item><item><title>Suburban Cabana</title><link>/gallery/suburban-cabana/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 01:18:41 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/suburban-cabana/</guid><description>I was just going for some generic infrastructure shots in this little community courtyard/garden area in Calgary, and I got this shot that looked a lot more like a travel advertisement for some nice California beaches or something. Pretty neat considering this was in Calgary!</description></item></channel></rss>
