Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a zoom lens so this photo hopefully captures more accurately what the real experience is like seeing the sun through eclipse glasses.
A few weeks before the eclipse, I suggested to one of my good friends that we organize a small trip to see the total solar eclipse. That small group ended up becoming 10 or so people, and we struggled for a while coming to a decision on where to go.</description></item><item><title>Horrible</title><link>/gallery/horrible/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 23:54:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>/gallery/horrible/</guid><description>These vibes are just straight horrible.

Sometime during 2am, my friend and roommate Mia told us that it looked friggin crazy outside. I guess she saw some fog outside her bedroom window? In any case, she ran out with her camera, and so obviously I had to run out with my own camera as well.
The atmosphere was chilly and misty. The droplets of mist lingering in the air diffused the amber glow from the streetlights around us.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9948</title><link>/gallery/kitchen-sink/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:09:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/kitchen-sink/</guid><description>In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what&amp;rsquo;s attached to the faucet, those are the pipes connected to a detachable dishwasher unit!
The house didn&amp;rsquo;t come with a dishwasher when it was built, so I guess some previous tenants bought a separate one. It was kind of annoying using it though, because you&amp;rsquo;re just not able to have a good user experience using the sink while it&amp;rsquo;s connected to the dishwasher.
There&amp;rsquo;s a little red button on the valve connected to the faucet that when pressed, will let the sink water flow out through the bottom.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9889</title><link>/gallery/bookstore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 16:33:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/bookstore/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jaundice</title><link>/gallery/jaundice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:13:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/jaundice/</guid><description>This wall looks DISGUSTING! In a good way (I think?) I took this photo in the men&amp;rsquo;s room of a rather dilapidated Toys R&amp;rsquo; Us. I didn&amp;rsquo;t capture any photos of the bathroom stalls, but they were painted this really nasty rotting seafoam green that just didn&amp;rsquo;t compliment anything in the room at all. And the floor tiles also had this gross yellowing on them that brought me back into a VHS-era local community centre.</description></item><item><title>DSCF8827</title><link>/gallery/envelopes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:27:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/envelopes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF8801</title><link>/gallery/corner-store/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 12:18:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/corner-store/</guid><description>For 2 months during the summer this photo was taken, I worked full-time at a grocery store! It was a goal of mine for quite a while to experience working a job that isn&amp;rsquo;t just software engineering, where I sit in the same desk in front of the same computer screen and talk to the same people every day1, and so when I finally had an off-term from school, I was super stoked to try new things.</description></item><item><title>DSCF8767</title><link>/gallery/green-cafe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 11:37:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/green-cafe/</guid><description>I went on some like six hour walk in Vancouver downtown on the day I took this photo. There&amp;rsquo;s such a good feeling in just being able to pick any random location to go, and then actually go there. As dumb as it sounds, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m in control of the world. Or I guess just my world.</description></item><item><title>DSCF8644</title><link>/gallery/monopoly-deal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 16:59:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/monopoly-deal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Slow Down</title><link>/gallery/slow-down/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 19:46:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/slow-down/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF4185</title><link>/gallery/trainyard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:50:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/trainyard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Phonebooth</title><link>/gallery/phonebooth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 11:00:31 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/phonebooth/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Skeleton</title><link>/gallery/skeleton/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 02:28:16 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/skeleton/</guid><description>I took this photo on a random day where I decided to take a 6-hour walk. I started in the morning around 8:00 AM, then just picked random directions and went wherever I felt like going. It was a frictionless day. The decisions I made affected no one else but me.</description></item><item><title>NOW PLAYING</title><link>/gallery/now-playing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:58:10 +0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/now-playing/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s this really cool retro-style pink-coloured snack bar inside the theatre with neon signs and cool popcorn machines and one of those signs with blocky letters that you attach to pegholes and anyways it was just a very nice vibe.
I asked the guy working there if it was alright to take a photo of him working there because I thought of this whole composition in my mind where it&amp;rsquo;s some dude doing his local small cinema tasks next to the popcorn machine and the candy jars and anyways he said &amp;ldquo;No.</description></item><item><title>DSCF3851</title><link>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:53:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mini-waterfall/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Long Way Back</title><link>/gallery/long-way-back/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 11:52:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/long-way-back/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made the drive between Calgary and Vancouver quite a few times now. It always sounds pretty daunting before the journey begins because it&amp;rsquo;s a whole flippin&amp;rsquo; 10 hour drive!!! But once we&amp;rsquo;re actually on the road it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad. You get to just enter a zen flow state and watch the trees pass by, mountains change their shapes, and the sky get darker and darker&amp;hellip; ok maybe that part isn&amp;rsquo;t as cool.</description></item><item><title>GULF OF GEORGIA CANNERY</title><link>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:22:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</guid><description>Just a shot of a building I saw at the Steveston Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf.

I found this wall while roaming around the Life Building on UBC campus with Jasmine during some late night study trip. Or at least I think we were studying. Surely I was studying like a good student right? :D</description></item><item><title>20210828_193529</title><link>/gallery/red-building/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 19:35:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-building/</guid><description>I took this photo while waiting in line for some apparently CRAZY GOOD ramen at Ramen Danbo! The line did not lie, the ramen was worth lining up for. I got some spicy ramen that my stomach didn&amp;rsquo;t end up quite agreeing with, but it was still an enjoyable experience! I think?</description></item><item><title>Cool Rock I Found</title><link>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 15:50:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</guid><description>I found this rock existing in its natural state.

I love the moodiness in this photo, combined with the black electric fan that almost looks like it&amp;rsquo;s feeling sad, head tilted downwards, staring at the floor, standing out of the sunlight.</description></item></channel></rss>
