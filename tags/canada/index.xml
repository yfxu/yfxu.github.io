It was a goal of mine for quite a while to experience working a job that isn&amp;rsquo;t just software engineering, where I sit in the same desk in front of the same computer screen and talk to the same people every day1, and so when I finally had an off-term from school, I was super stoked to try new things.</description></item><item><title>NOW PLAYING</title><link>/gallery/now-playing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 12:58:10 +0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/now-playing/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s this really cool retro-style pink-coloured snack bar inside the theatre with neon signs and cool popcorn machines and one of those signs with blocky letters that you attach to pegholes and anyways it was just a very nice vibe.
I asked the guy working there if it was alright to take a photo of him working there because I thought of this whole composition in my mind where it&amp;rsquo;s some dude doing his local small cinema tasks next to the popcorn machine and the candy jars and anyways he said &amp;ldquo;No.</description></item><item><title>GULF OF GEORGIA CANNERY</title><link>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:22:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</guid><description>Just a shot of a building I saw at the Steveston Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf. I liked the lens flare that I accidentally got in the photo. It gives the photo a bit of a nostalgic feeling.</description></item><item><title>20220417_162453</title><link>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 16:24:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</guid><description>The bridge was very green and the sky was very blue so I was like &amp;ldquo;mmm yes cool shot&amp;rdquo; and then I took the photo.</description></item><item><title>20210922_224502</title><link>/gallery/audio-visual-room/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 22:45:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/audio-visual-room/</guid><description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t this wall just so yellow??
I found this wall while roaming around the Life Building on UBC campus with Jasmine during some late night study trip. Or at least I think we were studying. Surely I was studying like a good student right? :D</description></item><item><title>20210828_193529</title><link>/gallery/red-building/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 19:35:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-building/</guid><description>I took this photo while waiting in line for some apparently CRAZY GOOD ramen at Ramen Danbo! The line did not lie, the ramen was worth lining up for. I got some spicy ramen that my stomach didn&amp;rsquo;t end up quite agreeing with, but it was still an enjoyable experience! I think?</description></item><item><title>Cool Rock I Found</title><link>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 15:50:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</guid><description>I found this rock existing in its natural state.

Pretty neat considering this was in Calgary!</description></item><item><title>20201030_110204</title><link>/gallery/offline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:02:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/offline/</guid><description>The lighting in my bedroom was simply too impeccable at the time to pass up on quick photo. I love the moodiness in this photo, combined with the black electric fan that almost looks like it&amp;rsquo;s feeling sad, head tilted downwards, staring at the floor, standing out of the sunlight.</description></item></channel></rss>
