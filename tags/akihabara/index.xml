It&amp;rsquo;s quite the liberating feeling, being able to just walk into the middle of the road without running the risk of dying to a car! Especially in a city built as dense as Tokyo, it&amp;rsquo;s a very welcome breather to have.
I took this photo on the day after Mia arrived in Japan.</description></item><item><title>Akihabara Overblown</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 12:03:59 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</guid><description>I process most of my images through Filmulator. While playing around with the settings, I found a way to really make the image look a bit deep fried and oversaturated, blasted with colours that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually see in real life. This is one of my photographs which met such a demise. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fitting though, given how colorful Akihabara actually still is, despite not necessarily being &amp;ldquo;deep fried&amp;rdquo; irl.</description></item></channel></rss>
