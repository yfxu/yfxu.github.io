Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn&amp;rsquo;t completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds.</description></item><item><title>Ludibrium</title><link>/gallery/ludibrium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:20:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ludibrium/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Step Right Up</title><link>/gallery/step-right-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 21:07:12 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/step-right-up/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7242</title><link>/gallery/cafe-snc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 14:34:01 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cafe-snc/</guid><description>Not a sponsored post

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t in our plans to visit it but the building was just so unbelievably wide and tall; we had to check it out. Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to capture any photos of the inside as photography was prohibited.
Right next to the temple is a little visitor&amp;rsquo;s centre, and that building somehow was just built with so many different rooms and spaces.</description></item><item><title>DSCF6961</title><link>/gallery/red-umbrella/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 15:41:21 -0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-umbrella/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7117</title><link>/gallery/kimonos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 17:49:03 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/kimonos/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF6744</title><link>/gallery/station-kimono/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 19:34:37 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/station-kimono/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Faceless</title><link>/gallery/faceless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 19:28:36 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/faceless/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF6123</title><link>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 16:37:24 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Playground</title><link>/gallery/playground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 01:15:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/playground/</guid><description>Part 3 of 3 Part 2
Uhhhhh I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what to talk about here. I found this playground that looked somewhat creepy in the dead of the night. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll flesh out this part some other time XDDD</description></item><item><title>Ominous Alley</title><link>/gallery/ominous-alley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:32:07 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ominous-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Street in Kagurazaka</title><link>/gallery/street-in-kagurazaka/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:31:26 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/street-in-kagurazaka/</guid><description>Part 2 of 3 Part 1
The streets were so utterly silent and empty. I guess having gotten used to living in Ginza, being in a relatively more suburban community felt so off-putting because there were next to no sounds at all. And you&amp;rsquo;d think that in a metropolitan region as dense as Tokyo, SURELY there&amp;rsquo;d always be something happening somewhere right? Well I guess my brain is probably just deep fried from too much pop culture or media or whatever.</description></item><item><title>Nice Comfy Hotel</title><link>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:21:25 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</guid><description>Part 1 of 3 Jasmine and her friends arrived in Japan 1 day after I had to move out of my Ginza apartment. This left me with one day in-between to find some temporary accommodation. I elected to try staying in one of those msytical CAPSULE HOTELS that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so much about on social media.
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen photos of them, a capsule hotel is essentially just an accommodation where instead of renting out rooms or suites for the night, you rent out a small rectangular prism of space inside a wall that has nothing more than a twin-sized futon and probably a few hooks for your coats.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5840</title><link>/gallery/sakura-kei/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:55 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakura-kei/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5839</title><link>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:23 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</guid><description>This place gets reaaaaaal busy during Hanami, and understandably so. I came here on multiple different occasions just to take pictures of the cherry blossoms because yeah I&amp;rsquo;m basic like that.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I made sure to get lots of random things in this picture to make it unique, and I also tuned up the saturation way past what they actually look like in real life. Rest assured, Naka-Meguro is still a very pretty place in person even if your eyeballs don&amp;rsquo;t have the latest saturation-boosting mods installed.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5755</title><link>/gallery/sakurain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:07:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakurain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hong Kong Alley</title><link>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:12:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Taiwanese Alley</title><link>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:10:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5603</title><link>/gallery/chinatown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 20:40:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/chinatown/</guid><description>Usually you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&amp;rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that lively.</description></item><item><title>Tsukiji Motorcycle</title><link>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:32:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lanterns</title><link>/gallery/lanterns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:23:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/lanterns/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5446</title><link>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:22:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Delivery</title><link>/gallery/delivery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:20:57 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/delivery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5431</title><link>/gallery/the-director/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:15:54 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/the-director/</guid><description>This photo was taken from up on top of a little bridge connecting two buildings in the Tsukiji Outer Market. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how intentional this photo was, but I think the traffic director looks super cool in this composition.
I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people working as these types of traffic control officers in Japan. They work late into the nights guarding building garage entrances too. It must get kinda cold doing that type of job late at night.</description></item><item><title>Train Cabin</title><link>/gallery/train-cabin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:07:38 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/train-cabin/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5198</title><link>/gallery/listless-dream/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:05:38 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/listless-dream/</guid><description>This photo was taken while I was riding the Tobu-Nikko line, somewhere in the middle of Saitama City. It&amp;rsquo;s got such a dreamy, liminal quality it has from the blurred subjects and overexposed whites with a little bit of the cold blue sky still present. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken that really evokes emotion in me whenever I see it. What emotion that is, I really do not know how to describe.</description></item><item><title>Drugstore</title><link>/gallery/drugstore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 10:40:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/drugstore/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hot Dog Stand</title><link>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 19:24:50 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hot-dog-stand/</guid><description>I was trying to get one of those really cool urban neon-Tokyo vibes shots of a man chilling at a food stall underneath neon lights. I think my composition kinda sucked though because I felt quite self-conscious about photographing strangers, which may or may not be a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make my photos have a more human and present feeling to them though.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5070</title><link>/gallery/red-bike/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 20:59:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-bike/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Busy Dinner</title><link>/gallery/busy-dinner/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 21:39:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/busy-dinner/</guid><description>I love the chaotic energy of Izakayas.</description></item><item><title>Downtown Akihabara Street</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-street/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 13:18:46 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-street/</guid><description>On Sunday afternoons, the main street of Akihabara is closed off to vehicles, allowing pedestrians to freely roam the streets! It&amp;rsquo;s quite the liberating feeling, being able to just walk into the middle of the road without running the risk of dying to a car! Especially in a city built as dense as Tokyo, it&amp;rsquo;s a very welcome breather to have.
I took this photo on the day after Mia arrived in Japan.</description></item><item><title>Akihabara Overblown</title><link>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 12:03:59 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/akihabara-overblown/</guid><description>I process most of my images through Filmulator. While playing around with the settings, I found a way to really make the image look a bit deep fried and oversaturated, blasted with colours that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually see in real life. This is one of my photographs which met such a demise. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fitting though, given how colorful Akihabara actually still is, despite not necessarily being &amp;ldquo;deep fried&amp;rdquo; irl.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4626</title><link>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 11:57:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tight-squeeze/</guid><description>Just a cool a little alley I stumbled across.

Japan celebrates a statutory holiday called &amp;ldquo;Sports Day&amp;rdquo; every year. It&amp;rsquo;s a day dedicated to the pursuit of health and longevity through physical activities and general healthy lifestyle choices.
To celebrate this day, I joined a few of my fellow co-op student friends on a day trip to hike Mount Takao, or &amp;ldquo;Takaosan,&amp;rdquo; as the Japanese name would be romanized. Mount Takao is relatively accessible from central Tokyo, with a single train line travelling from Shinjuku Station all the way to the foot of Mount Takao.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4450</title><link>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:14:04 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some cool mysterious stairs we saw from when I hiked Mount Takao with some friends. There were an awful lot of stairs on this mountain hike.

It&amp;rsquo;s got that super down-to-earth cheap wooden tables and plastic chairs vibe all about, where people can yap about their lives and stuff while chowing down chicken skewers and beer. The entire street glows with a comfy amber aura throughout the evening while customers come and go.
The first time I came here, I vowed to never eat at any of the restaurants until my girlfriend would eventually come visit in Japan 7 months later.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4271</title><link>/gallery/shibuya-signs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 19:48:03 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/shibuya-signs/</guid><description>Everyone with a camera has to take one those token Shibuya-Neon-Lights-City-That-Never-Sleeps type photographs when they visit Japan right? Well, here&amp;rsquo;s one!
This was taken on my first night ever checking out Shibuya. Despite already having seen tons of these types of photos online before moving to Tokyo, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare to actually standing right in the middle of the visual and audial cacophany in-person. Seeing all the lights and signs which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand felt magical.</description></item></channel></rss>
