You just kinda hold down the shutter button and wave the camera around like your in-game sensitivity is on 10.0x, and then release and look at the cool little pattern you get!
This one was taken inside the Chihuly Glass Museum, specifically inside this one room where the entire ceiling was full of various coloured glass sculptures with warm light filtering through it.</description></item><item><title>Jaundice</title><link>/gallery/jaundice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:13:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/jaundice/</guid><description>This wall looks DISGUSTING! In a good way (I think?) I took this photo in the men&amp;rsquo;s room of a rather dilapidated Toys R&amp;rsquo; Us. I didn&amp;rsquo;t capture any photos of the bathroom stalls, but they were painted this really nasty rotting seafoam green that just didn&amp;rsquo;t compliment anything in the room at all. And the floor tiles also had this gross yellowing on them that brought me back into a VHS-era local community centre.</description></item><item><title>Dreamweaver</title><link>/gallery/dreamweaver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 16:21:32 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/dreamweaver/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Meteors</title><link>/gallery/meteors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 16:12:26 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/meteors/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
