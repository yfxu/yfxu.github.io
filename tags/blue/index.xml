It&amp;rsquo;s got such a dreamy, liminal quality it has from the blurred subjects and overexposed whites with a little bit of the cold blue sky still present. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken that really evokes emotion in me whenever I see it. What emotion that is, I really do not know how to describe.</description></item><item><title>20220417_162453</title><link>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 16:24:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</guid><description>The bridge was very green and the sky was very blue so I was like &amp;ldquo;mmm yes cool shot&amp;rdquo; and then I took the photo.</description></item></channel></rss>
