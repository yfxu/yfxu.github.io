Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a zoom lens so this photo hopefully captures more accurately what the real experience is like seeing the sun through eclipse glasses.
A few weeks before the eclipse, I suggested to one of my good friends that we organize a small trip to see the total solar eclipse. That small group ended up becoming 10 or so people, and we struggled for a while coming to a decision on where to go.</description></item><item><title>Horrible</title><link>/gallery/horrible/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 23:54:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>/gallery/horrible/</guid><description>These vibes are just straight horrible.

Sometime during 2am, my friend and roommate Mia told us that it looked friggin crazy outside. I guess she saw some fog outside her bedroom window? In any case, she ran out with her camera, and so obviously I had to run out with my own camera as well.
The atmosphere was chilly and misty. The droplets of mist lingering in the air diffused the amber glow from the streetlights around us.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9948</title><link>/gallery/kitchen-sink/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:09:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/kitchen-sink/</guid><description>In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what&amp;rsquo;s attached to the faucet, those are the pipes connected to a detachable dishwasher unit!
The house didn&amp;rsquo;t come with a dishwasher when it was built, so I guess some previous tenants bought a separate one. It was kind of annoying using it though, because you&amp;rsquo;re just not able to have a good user experience using the sink while it&amp;rsquo;s connected to the dishwasher.
There&amp;rsquo;s a little red button on the valve connected to the faucet that when pressed, will let the sink water flow out through the bottom.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9889</title><link>/gallery/bookstore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 16:33:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/bookstore/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On the Rocks</title><link>/gallery/on-the-rocks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 18:51:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/on-the-rocks/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF9619</title><link>/gallery/lone-seaweed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 16:35:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/lone-seaweed/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stearns Wharf</title><link>/gallery/stearns-wharf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 18:09:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/stearns-wharf/</guid><description>I never grew up around the ocean, but sometimes I feel like I was a fisherman in a past life. I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that one of the most blissful feelings to ever experience is the sensation of the ocean breeze flowing past your face as you smell the salty air and listen to the waves gently crash over and over again. I think I could sit on this pier and just look out into the distance for a while without having any thoughts cross my mind.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9400</title><link>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 17:32:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/santa-barbara-palm-trees/</guid><description>Honestly this is kinda just a filler photo to put in the gallery to make myself seem more well-travelled ! aHA !
This photo was taken on a short trip with my girlfriend when we visited her Dad in Los Angeles. We spent 2 days in Santa Barbara, and it was the first time in many years that I&amp;rsquo;d been to a token California beach.
It was hot and humid, and neither my girlfriend nor I were able to think with more than six combined brain cells because we were both physically and mentally melting in real life!</description></item><item><title>Ruby</title><link>/gallery/ruby/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 13:46:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ruby/</guid><description>Long exposure photography is pretty brainlessly fun! You just kinda hold down the shutter button and wave the camera around like your in-game sensitivity is on 10.0x, and then release and look at the cool little pattern you get!
This one was taken inside the Chihuly Glass Museum, specifically inside this one room where the entire ceiling was full of various coloured glass sculptures with warm light filtering through it.</description></item><item><title>DSCF9225</title><link>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 18:15:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/out-of-the-light/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jaundice</title><link>/gallery/jaundice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:13:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/jaundice/</guid><description>This wall looks DISGUSTING! In a good way (I think?) I took this photo in the men&amp;rsquo;s room of a rather dilapidated Toys R&amp;rsquo; Us. I didn&amp;rsquo;t capture any photos of the bathroom stalls, but they were painted this really nasty rotting seafoam green that just didn&amp;rsquo;t compliment anything in the room at all. And the floor tiles also had this gross yellowing on them that brought me back into a VHS-era local community centre.</description></item><item><title>DSCF8827</title><link>/gallery/envelopes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:27:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/envelopes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF8801</title><link>/gallery/corner-store/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 12:18:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/corner-store/</guid><description>For 2 months during the summer this photo was taken, I worked full-time at a grocery store!

Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn&amp;rsquo;t completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds.</description></item><item><title>Ludibrium</title><link>/gallery/ludibrium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 18:20:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/ludibrium/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Step Right Up</title><link>/gallery/step-right-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 21:07:12 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/step-right-up/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7242</title><link>/gallery/cafe-snc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 14:34:01 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cafe-snc/</guid><description>Not a sponsored post

Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to capture any photos of the inside as photography was prohibited.
Right next to the temple is a little visitor&amp;rsquo;s centre, and that building somehow was just built with so many different rooms and spaces.</description></item><item><title>DSCF6961</title><link>/gallery/red-umbrella/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 15:41:21 -0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-umbrella/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF7117</title><link>/gallery/kimonos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 17:49:03 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/kimonos/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF6744</title><link>/gallery/station-kimono/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 19:34:37 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/station-kimono/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Faceless</title><link>/gallery/faceless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 19:28:36 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/faceless/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF6123</title><link>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 16:37:24 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mt-fuji-from-owakudani/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Playground</title><link>/gallery/playground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 01:15:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/playground/</guid><description>Part 3 of 3 Part 2

The streets were so utterly silent and empty. I guess having gotten used to living in Ginza, being in a relatively more suburban community felt so off-putting because there were next to no sounds at all. And you&amp;rsquo;d think that in a metropolitan region as dense as Tokyo, SURELY there&amp;rsquo;d always be something happening somewhere right? Well I guess my brain is probably just deep fried from too much pop culture or media or whatever.</description></item><item><title>Nice Comfy Hotel</title><link>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:21:25 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/nice-comfy-hotel/</guid><description>Part 1 of 3 Jasmine and her friends arrived in Japan 1 day after I had to move out of my Ginza apartment. This left me with one day in-between to find some temporary accommodation. I elected to try staying in one of those mystical CAPSULE HOTELS that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so much about on social media.
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen photos of them, a capsule hotel is essentially just an accommodation where instead of renting out rooms or suites for the night, you rent out a small rectangular prism of space inside a wall that has nothing more than a twin-sized futon and probably a few hooks for your coats.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5840</title><link>/gallery/sakura-kei/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:55 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakura-kei/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5839</title><link>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 12:23:23 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/naka-meguro-overblown/</guid><description>This place gets reaaaaaal busy during Hanami, and understandably so. I came here on multiple different occasions just to take pictures of the cherry blossoms because yeah I&amp;rsquo;m basic like that.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I made sure to get lots of random things in this picture to make it unique, and I also tuned up the saturation way past what they actually look like in real life. Rest assured, Naka-Meguro is still a very pretty place in person even if your eyeballs don&amp;rsquo;t have the latest saturation-boosting mods installed.</description></item><item><title>DSCF5755</title><link>/gallery/sakurain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:07:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/sakurain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hong Kong Alley</title><link>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:12:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/hong-kong-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Taiwanese Alley</title><link>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:10:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/taiwanese-alley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5603</title><link>/gallery/chinatown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 20:40:05 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/chinatown/</guid><description>Usually you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&amp;rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that lively.</description></item><item><title>Tsukiji Motorcycle</title><link>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:32:40 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/tsukiji-motorcycle/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lanterns</title><link>/gallery/lanterns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:23:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/lanterns/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5446</title><link>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:22:11 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/shrine-entrance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Delivery</title><link>/gallery/delivery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:20:57 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/delivery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DSCF5431</title><link>/gallery/the-director/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 13:15:54 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/the-director/</guid><description>This photo was taken from up on top of a little bridge connecting two buildings in the Tsukiji Outer Market.

I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people working as these types of traffic control officers in Japan. They work late into the nights guarding building garage entrances too.

To celebrate this day, I joined a few of my fellow co-op student friends on a day trip to hike Mount Takao, or &amp;ldquo;Takaosan,&amp;rdquo; as the Japanese name would be romanized. Mount Takao is relatively accessible from central Tokyo, with a single train line travelling from Shinjuku Station all the way to the foot of Mount Takao.</description></item><item><title>DSCF4450</title><link>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:14:04 +0900</pubDate><guid>/gallery/mysterious-stairs/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some cool mysterious stairs we saw from when I hiked Mount Takao with some friends.

You get to just enter a zen flow state and watch the trees pass by, mountains change their shapes, and the sky get darker and darker&amp;hellip; ok maybe that part isn&amp;rsquo;t as cool.</description></item><item><title>GULF OF GEORGIA CANNERY</title><link>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:22:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/gulf-of-georgia-cannery/</guid><description>Just a shot of a building I saw at the Steveston Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf. I liked the lens flare that I accidentally got in the photo. It gives the photo a bit of a nostalgic feeling.</description></item><item><title>20220417_162453</title><link>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 16:24:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>/gallery/large-green-bridge/</guid><description>The bridge was very green and the sky was very blue so I was like &amp;ldquo;mmm yes cool shot&amp;rdquo; and then I took the photo.</description></item><item><title>20210922_224502</title><link>/gallery/audio-visual-room/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 22:45:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/audio-visual-room/</guid><description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t this wall just so yellow??
I found this wall while roaming around the Life Building on UBC campus with Jasmine during some late night study trip. Or at least I think we were studying. Surely I was studying like a good student right? :D</description></item><item><title>20210828_193529</title><link>/gallery/red-building/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 19:35:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/red-building/</guid><description>I took this photo while waiting in line for some apparently CRAZY GOOD ramen at Ramen Danbo! The line did not lie, the ramen was worth lining up for. I got some spicy ramen that my stomach didn&amp;rsquo;t end up quite agreeing with, but it was still an enjoyable experience! I think?</description></item><item><title>Cool Rock I Found</title><link>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 15:50:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/gallery/cool-rock-i-found/</guid><description>I found this rock existing in its natural state.

Pretty neat considering this was in Calgary!</description></item><item><title>20201030_110204</title><link>/gallery/offline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:02:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>/gallery/offline/</guid><description>The lighting in my bedroom was simply too impeccable at the time to pass up on quick photo. I love the moodiness in this photo, combined with the black electric fan that almost looks like it&amp;rsquo;s feeling sad, head tilted downwards, staring at the floor, standing out of the sunlight.</description></item></channel></rss>
