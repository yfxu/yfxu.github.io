I guess having gotten used to living in Ginza, being in a relatively more suburban community felt so off-putting because there were next to no sounds at all. And you&rsquo;d think that in a metropolitan region as dense as Tokyo, SURELY there&rsquo;d always be something happening somewhere right? Well I guess my brain is probably just deep fried from too much pop culture or media or whatever. As it so turns out, people also do like to sleep at night there!</p><p>Once I left the hotel, I pretty much just picked random directions to start walking in. I was hoping to find anything minorly cool to take photos of.</p><p>There were a few restaurants I passed by, lots of residential houses, and lots of vending machines too. During the walk I filmed a short video where I just talked into the camera while walking, talking about where I was going and whatever else was on my mind. It was a weird feeling. Although I was walking outside in a wide-open space, it felt like I could hear my own voice brush up really close against my ears, the same way you might hear yourself if you stuck yourself into a locker and closed the door behind you, then started reciting a soliloquy or something.</p><p>It was straaaange, and liminal too!</p><p><a href=/gallery/playground>Part 3</a></p></article><hr><footer><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>source</a>
