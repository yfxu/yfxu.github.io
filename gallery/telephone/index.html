It wasn&rsquo;t in our plans to visit it but the building was just so unbelievably wide and tall; we had to check it out. Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to capture any photos of the inside as photography was prohibited.</p><p>Right next to the temple is a little visitor&rsquo;s centre, and that building somehow was just built with so many different rooms and spaces. There were long flights of stairs, ramps, large atriums, and you would not have any idea at all that you&rsquo;re right next to a traditional Japanese temple.</p><p>Inside one of the small rooms in that building, there was this lone telephone-looking object placed on a desk that was otherwise empty. Who uses that room? No clue.</p></article><hr><footer><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>source</a>
