But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren&rsquo;t too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn&rsquo;t seem all that lively. Maybe they were all at home celebrating with their families :crying_emoji:</p><p>I visited a gift store that was still open and defaulted to speaking Mandarin instead of Japanese, but the shopkeeper told me in Japanese that she couldn&rsquo;t speak any Chinese! Not that it&rsquo;s bad or anything, but just a very interesting situation all around!</p></article><hr><footer><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>source</a>
