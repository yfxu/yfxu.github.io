Today, I had the opportunity to listen in on an online cybersecurity presentation delivered live by [Paul Davis](https://socialnetworkingsafety.net/). He's both a father and an experienced IT professional who now works as an educator and advocator for online safety, frequently appearing as a guest speaker at schools and on TV. 

The speech that I listened to today was directed towards parents of [middle school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school#Canada) students, offering insight on what parents should be doing for their kids in our current digital age, and what they can do themselves to enhance their own digital privacy. Since I was at the dinner table with them, I listened alongside my parents to what the guy had to say.

For various "legal reasons" he never went into, the Zoom meeting wasn't allowed to be recorded and uploaded anywhere. To be honest, I can't really think of what those reasons might be, but whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Here's the best summary I can make:
* Parents need to play an active role in regulating their children's online lives in order to protect them from dangerous websites and/or developing technology addictions
* It is the parents' responsibility to firmly establish a safe space where their kids can talk to them about any problems they might be experiencing (especially online) free from judgment or embarassment
* People need to develop better password usage and management habits, suggesting they use a hand-written password notebook instead of password manager software
* Parents should disallow their kids from bringing any type of electronic devices into their rooms
* TikTok is bad

Overall, it was a fairly all-encompassing presentation that touched upon a decent number of topics. He had a surprising amount of teenager-level "street" knowledge too. For example. this was the first time I'd heard any adult explicitly mentioning the sexual connotations behind certain emojis, or that Discord is mostly a male-dominated platform. He also gave a lot of hard rules and numbers such as:

> "kids should never have a smart phone until the end of Grade 8" 

> "34 minutes of screen time allowed per day"

These weren't directly quoted (because I didn't take notes), but they're pretty close to what he said. That all said, I agreed with some of his points, and disagreed with some as well. In my personal opinion, his suggestions tended to be a bit too authoritarian, but it made sense given that he has children of his own to protect, and he's also aware of the potential evils of the ScARY InTerWEbZ!!

However, some of the things he said were so utterly unhinged from a parenting perspective that I felt compelled to write up a whole blog post about it. Because he speaks to so many different people, there are bound to be parents who are uneducated on digital life topics accepting his advice 100% without discretion. This is a problem because some of his suggestions can be very damaging to parent-child relationships, and that's not okay, *especially* when---as far as I can tell---there's no one else challenging his words.

Being someone who is still figuring out the transition from "teenager" to "adult," I hope that I can provide a fresh perspective from the view of someone slightly older than the type of person Paul Davis wants to protect.

Here are some specific points he mentioned that I strongly disagree with:

## "Parents should always know each and every one of their child's login credentials"

No, absolutely not. Paul had a fantastic point that parents and their kids need to build transparent relationships where both parties feel safe enough to talk about issues like cyberbullying or other mistakes they may have made. When parents demand control of their kids' personal online lives, it's *pretty hard* to build that trust necessary for such a relationship to succeed.

Now of course, I should mention that I do not have access to brains of every child on Earth. Some kids may be perfectly fine with sharing their login information with their parents, and that's okay! However, telling people that EVERY parent should keep track of their children's login credentials will create some pretty nasty trust issues in some households. Kids are individuals too. While it could be acknowledged that they technically "belong" to their parents, young children still have their own set of thoughts and their own lives separate from their parents. Violating those boundaries can severely affect a developing child's openness to their parents, especially when they enter their teen years, a time commonly known to be the "[rebellious years](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/youve-had-baby-now-what/201906/rebellion-and-defiance-in-adolescents)" of an adolescent.

Furthermore, knowing their credentials doesn't really empower a parent to do anything they couldn't already do. Unless you're willing to create router rules that completely block Instagram on your home Wi-Fi, being able to access little Joey's Instagram account isn't gonna stop him from [being an absolute menace](#). And even if you do block that access, they can just circumvent it with a VPN.

I think the better option is to teach kids how to properly navigate social media rather than being a helicopter parent. Talk about acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and educate them about potential consequences they could face online. I've never heard of this site before, but [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/) has [a page](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/social-media/should-i-demand-my-kids-passwords-to-his-or-her-social-websites-and-apps) that puts it very succinctly:

> \[Work\] together to make sure your kids develop their own sense of responsibility... and take an interest in their online activities.

## "Kids should be prohibited from using [*textspeak*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language) online"

Paul's reasoning for this is that young adults have sent genuine "professional" e-mails and résumés with content like "I'd &#x2764; to work for u!" Presumably, the fear is that by frequently sending these types of informal texts, children will slowly forget how to properly conduct themselves in a more serious manner. And to be clear, these things DO happen. One of my personal favorites is [this 2004 résumé](https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/comments/5gmisw/presenting_my_2004_resume_theyll_hire_me_for_sure/) from [u/zaddawadda](https://www.reddit.com/user/zaddawadda).

All things considered, this point is kind of silly. This is honestly a very petty thing to do and ends up makes a similar mistake in trying too hard to protect someone, rather than teaching them how to be better.

* Children should not be allowed to bring any electronics into their own room

The gist of his presentation:
* child access to the internet must be regulated by parents (fair enough)
* unrestricted, young teens can and will engage in online activities that are a bit risque for their age (sounds about right)
* parents MUST establish with their kids that they are free to talk to them about anything without fear of judgment or resentment (absolutely)
* technology should never enter the bedroom (maybe a bit questionable)
* minimize the personal info you put online
* read terms and conditions

My response:
* this post is focused on the parenting side of things
* felt compelled to write about this because of how many people he's spoken to
    * 1 single person with their own opinion having a monopoly on teaching children and adults can't be good
* I want parents to have access to as much information as they can before 
* I feel as if I was still very recently one of those people that he was talking about needing to protect
    * offer insight as a "kid" even tho I'm 20

eg:
* kids don't have privacy
    * no they absolutely do and you cannot advocate for transparency and building trust with your kids without acknowledging this

* my dad raised the point that kids will always eventually have to confront the real world as it is
* delaying that will more likely harm them than do them good
* we should aim more to teach and engage people with the scary things than to protect them from it
    * one form of protection is becoming familiar

Also don't use [netlingo](https://www.netlingo.com/), use [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) instead. It's much more comprehensive because it supports user-submissions while also supporting user ratings. That way, you'll know when an entry is bogus and when it's not. It also has a much better UI than netlingo IMHO BTW
