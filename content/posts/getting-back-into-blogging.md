Back in early 2016, I created a Tumblr account because God knows why. Aha, actually it's because I sorta wanted to exercise my writing skills somewhere outside of school, and blogging seemed like a cool way to achieve that. Part of me actually enjoyed writing because it was a nice way to sort out some thoughts in my head, and overall, it was just a peaceful experience.

At the time, I thought my posts were pretty cool. At the time. UNFORTUNATELY, I recently decided to take a look at it again because I guess my brain didn't have enough embarassing childhood memories to deal with??? The posts really aren't that great. They read exactly like they were written by an edgy 15-year old high school student looking for cool ways to express their individuality, because that truly was the reality at the time. I was a cool hipster boy slapping away at my keyboard in my basement bedroom hoping to bump up my English mark by maybe one percent. Maybe I still am that same guy 🤔.

In total, I'd submitted 10 proper blog entries... over 33 days. Yeah, I stopped blogging after a month. It was pretty tiring thinking of new subjects to write about every one or two days, and maybe that's where I went wrong. A blog really should just be a place to dump some thoughts when you have them. It's not like I had any proper fanbase who actually CARED about what I wrote ;').

So what the heck am I doing here now? To be honest, I have no idea. Something like a sudden flash of inspiration must've gone through my head because I'm sitting here typing out a bunch of html documents without using a templating engine because GitHub offers FREE static web page hosting. Students love the word "free" by the way!

I also justified doing this at 3:00 AM by reminding myself that co-op student employability has dropped to be quite low during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning I'm gonna need a bit of extra pizzaz to distinguish myself from other similar candidates.

Oh and here is the forsaken Tumblr account: https://notxenon.tumblr.com/. Read with caution, or don't read it at all. The latter might be the better option.
