## Intro

I've decided to start making my own personal [Sound Voltex](https://remywiki.com/What_is_SOUND_VOLTEX) rhythm game controller. It'll be a project that involves electronics, maybe some PCB design, embedded programming, and 3D design.

## Why

While I was co-oping in Tokyo, I found myself visiting rhythm game arcades a lot. A few games that I really stuck with were *Chunithm*, *Dance Dance Revolution*, and *Sound Voltex*.

## Parts

I haven't yet picked out specific parts. I'll need:

- 2 rotary encoders (100-200 PPR minimum)
- 7 buttons (probably mechanical key switches)
