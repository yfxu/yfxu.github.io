Before the start of my 4A term at the University of Waterloo, I invested in a Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 (base model) with the primary intention of using it for note taking. It was a decision that I'd pondered for a while in the year before. The reason I hadn't caved in earlier was because of the lingering question: "Is it really worth it?"

Here are the benefits of using a tablet over traditional pen-and-paper note taking:
- Single lightweight and compact device compared to multiple larger/thicker notebooks, leaving you with more space to put other things
- Consolidates all of your notes into one place (you don't have to worry about leaving any notebooks at home)
