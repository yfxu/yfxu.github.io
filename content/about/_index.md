Hi, I'm Yifei Xu! 

Right now, I'm a third-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I impulsively set up this website one day after being inspired to maintain my own blog. Currently, I'm spending my time learning about anything that seems cool!

I was born in Beijing, China, but then my parents yanked me onto a one-way flight to Calgary, Canada before my first birthday. (An early birthday present???)

This website is where I'll talk about anything random that I feel is worth sharing. Enjoy your stay!

To make this page feel more substantial and lively, here's an uncategorized list of things I like:
* sushi
* osu! (you should totally check out my beatmaps)
* cozy spaces
* brown rice milk tea w/ pudding, 30% sugar, no ice
* things that look nice &#128526;
* cooking
* badminton
* web development
* that feeling when you successfully teach someone something new
