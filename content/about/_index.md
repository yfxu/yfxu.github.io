Hi, I'm Yifei (é€¸é£ž)! 

This is my personal website where I maintain a very cool blog and share various photos I've taken with my smartphone camera (Samsung Galaxy S9). Nowadays, I've also gotten into DSLR photography with a Fujifilm X100, but I post those over at my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196684962@N07/) instead. Enjoy your stay!

## life

I'm a fourth-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I was born in Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, but then my parents yanked me onto a one-way flight to Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ before my first birthday! Now I live wherever school and the rest of life take me.
