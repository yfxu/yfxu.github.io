Hi, I'm Yifei (é€¸é£ž)! 

This is my personal website where I maintain a very cool blog and share various photos I've taken with my smartphone camera (Samsung Galaxy S9). Enjoy your stay!

This website doesn't use any JavaScript or cookies, just some plain HTML and CSS built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The website theme was designed and coded by myself ! :D !

## more about me

I'm a fourth-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I was born in Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, but then my parents yanked me onto a one-way flight to Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ before my first birthday! Now I live wherever school and the rest of life take me.
