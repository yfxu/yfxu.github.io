Hi, I'm Yifei (é€¸é£ž)! 

This is my personal website where I maintain a very cool blog and share various photos I've taken on my camera (FujiFilm X100) and on my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S9).

This website doesn't use any JavaScript or cookies, just some plain HTML and CSS built with Hugo, hosted on GitHub Pages. The website theme was designed and coded by myself ! :D !

## life

I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I was born in Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, but then my parents yanked me onto a one-way flight to Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ before my first birthday! Now I live wherever life takes me.

I've previously interned at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/ca/), [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/), [Fleet](https://www.movewithfleet.com/), [OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/), and [eCompliance](https://www.ecompliance.com/).
