This place gets reaaaaaal busy during [Hanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami), and understandably so. I came here on multiple different occasions just to take pictures of the cherry blossoms because yeah I'm basic like that.

But don't worry, I made sure to get lots of random things in this picture to make it unique, and I also tuned up the saturation way past what they actually look like in real life. Rest assured, Naka-Meguro is still a very pretty place in person even if your eyeballs don't have the latest saturation-boosting mods installed.
