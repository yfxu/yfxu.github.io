Long exposure photography is pretty brainlessly fun! You just kinda hold down the shutter button and wave the camera around like your in-game sensitivity is on 10.0x, and then release and look at the cool little pattern you get!

This one was taken inside the Chihuly Glass Museum, specifically inside this one room where the entire ceiling was full of various coloured glass sculptures with warm light filtering through it.
