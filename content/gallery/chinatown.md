Usually you're supposed to go back home with your family to celebrate Chinese New Year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas. But I, being all alone in Tokyo, was unable to visit home, so I decided to just visit Yokohama Chinatown to see what was going on over there. Maybe I just got there too late or something, but there actually weren't too many people. Some gift shops and restaurants were still open and all, but it didn't seem all that lively. Maybe they were all at home celebrating with their families :crying_emoji:

I visited a gift store that was still open and defaulted to speaking Mandarin instead of Japanese, but the shopkeeper told me in Japanese that she couldn't speak any Chinese! Not that it's bad or anything, but just a very interesting situation all around!
