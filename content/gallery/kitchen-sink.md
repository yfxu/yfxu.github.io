In case you're wondering what's attached to the faucet, those are the pipes connected to a detachable dishwasher unit!

The house didn't come with a dishwasher when it was built, so I guess some previous tenants bought a separate one. It was kind of annoying using it though, because you're just not able to have a good user experience using the sink while it's connected to the dishwasher.

There's a little red button on the valve connected to the faucet that when pressed, will let the sink water flow out through the bottom. But that's also the same opening where the used dishwater fluid gets dumped, and it also comes out with the force of a pressure washer so you're kinda just doomed.
