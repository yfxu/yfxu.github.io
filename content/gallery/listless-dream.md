This photo was taken while I was riding the Tobu-Nikko line, somewhere in the middle of Saitama City. It's got such a dreamy, liminal quality it has from the blurred subjects and overexposed whites with a little bit of the cold blue sky still present. It's one of the few photos I've taken that really evokes emotion in me whenever I see it. What emotion that is, I really do not know how to describe. It's like a mix of wistfulness, nostalgia, dread, and something else down that alley. Combined with the unintentional-ness of the shot, this turned out to be one my personal favourite photographs from my time in Japan.
