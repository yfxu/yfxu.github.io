This photo was taken from up on top of a little bridge connecting two buildings in the Tsukiji Outer Market. I don't remember how intentional this photo was, but I think the traffic director looks super cool in this composition.

I noticed that there's a lot of people working as these types of traffic control officers in Japan. They work late into the nights guarding building garage entrances too. It must get kinda cold doing that type of job late at night.
