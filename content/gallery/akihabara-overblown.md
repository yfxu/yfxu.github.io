I process most of my images through [Filmulator](https://filmulator.org/). While playing around with the settings, I found a way to really make the image look a bit deep fried and oversaturated, blasted with colours that you wouldn't actually see in real life. This is one of my photographs which met such a demise. I think it's fitting though, given how colorful Akihabara actually still is, despite not necessarily being "deep fried" irl. Or maybe it is, up to everyone's own opinion I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I took this photo while exploring Akihabara with my good friend [Mia](https://www.instagram.com/woolseyoffline/) who had just landed the day before in Japan to visit me. It's not the main street in Akihabara, but I think it captures quite well the bustling and colorful nature of the district.
