I've made the drive between Calgary and Vancouver quite a few times now. It always sounds pretty daunting before the journey begins because it's a whole flippin' 10 hour drive!!! But once we're actually on the road it's not too bad. You get to just enter a zen flow state and watch the trees pass by, mountains change their shapes, and the sky get darker and darker... ok maybe that part isn't as cool.

I was not driving while taking this photo (or else I'd be posting proof of me doing illegal things), so I had the chance to snap a picture of the road in front of us. In this photo, we were driving eastward, back towards Calgary after a short two-week vacation in Vancouver.
