Everyone with a camera has to take one those token Shibuya-Neon-Lights-City-That-Never-Sleeps type photographs when they visit Japan right? Well, here's one!

This was taken on my first night ever checking out Shibuya. Despite already having seen tons of these types of photos online before moving to Tokyo, it still doesn't compare to actually standing right in the middle of the visual and audial cacophony in-person. Seeing all the lights and signs which I couldn't understand felt _magical_.
