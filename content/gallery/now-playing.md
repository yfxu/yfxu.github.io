There's this really cool retro-style pink-coloured snack bar inside the theatre with neon signs and cool popcorn machines and one of those signs with blocky letters that you attach to pegholes and anyways it was just a very nice vibe.

I asked the guy working there if it was alright to take a photo of him working there because I thought of this whole composition in my mind where it's some dude doing his local small cinema tasks next to the popcorn machine and the candy jars and anyways he said "No."

The way he said it was so impersonal. He delivered that "no" to me like it was just a fact, no opinion. He was reading from a textbook or something, and he just looked at me afterwards, and I wasn't even sure if he was expecting a response.
