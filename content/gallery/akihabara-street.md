On Sunday afternoons, the main street of Akihabara is closed off to vehicles, allowing pedestrians to freely roam the streets! It's quite the liberating feeling, being able to just walk into the middle of the road without running the risk of dying to a car! Especially in a city built as dense as Tokyo, it's a very welcome breather to have.

I took this photo on the day after Mia arrived in Japan. It was her first full day experiencing the country, and in that one single day we explored Akihabara, Harajuku, and Shibuya. It was quite the full day of walking and I'm sure my feet were not very happy with me!
