Shibuya Yokochou is a magical and noisy street filled with small restaurants along one side of the entire street. It's got that super down-to-earth cheap wooden tables and plastic chairs vibe all about, where people can yap about their lives and stuff while chowing down chicken skewers and beer. The entire street glows with a comfy amber aura throughout the evening while customers come and go.

The first time I came here, I vowed to never eat at any of the restaurants until my girlfriend would eventually come visit in Japan 7 months later. I wanted to save a few first-experiences for us to share together! And 7 months later, we did end up visiting the street together, but we never ended up eating anything because we'd already had dinner somewhere else nearby. Oh well XD

Apparently it's got a 2.4/5.0 star overall review from 1,331 total reviews at the time of writing this, so maybe the magic dies the moment you eat something.
