For 2 months during the summer this photo was taken, I worked full-time at a grocery store! It was a goal of mine for quite a while to experience working a job that isn't just software engineering, where I sit in the same desk in front of the same computer screen and talk to the same people every day[^1], and so when I finally had an off-term from school, I was super stoked to try new things.

[^1]: I don't mean this as a bash against my previous coworkers, like I have had genuine fun getting to know them and spent time with them outside work just enjoying life, but that sort of job doesn't lend itself much to spontaneity.
