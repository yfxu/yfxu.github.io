This photo actually has a somewhat funny story behind it :D

Sometime during 2am, my friend and roommate Mia told us that it looked friggin crazy outside. I guess she saw some fog outside her bedroom window? In any case, she ran out with her camera, and so obviously I had to run out with my own camera as well.

The atmosphere was chilly and misty. The droplets of mist lingering in the air diffused the amber glow from the streetlights around us. And so, everything was actually surprisingly bright, yet we also couldn't see that far because the fog eventually got too thick. The road was silent and empty, and so we decided to stand in the centre of the street because oh ho ho we are such rebels!!!

Eventually I was getting ready to go home, but Mia and I both started hearing a faint noise appear out of the void. As it got louder and louder, so did a strong white light get brighter and brighter emerging out of the mist. It was... somewhat creepy? Even though you know it has to just be a vehicle, becoming aware of someone else who's awake at that time when you thought you had the whole road to yourself feels just a tad bit unnerving.

The truck eventually did come our way, and so Mia and I stepped off to the side to snap some random shots of the truck as it drove past by us.

And then... the truck just did a U-turn and started driving straight towards us???

I was genuinely freaked out a little, like this is just not real life. A truck barreling back towards you after it just passed by, at 2am, when there's no one else out??? I honestly froze up a little because I wasn't sure what was about to happen. I unfortunately cannot physically outrun an automobile. Sidestepping it also seemed a little too risky and error-prone.

The truck continued driving towards us, not off the road so as to run us over, but it did begin to slow down as it got closer. And it got slower and slower until it came to a full stop right in front myself and Mia.

The window rolled down.

"Hey, are you guys taking photos?" The driver poked out of his window and lightly shouted to us, he was probably aware of his physical distance from us, but also didn't want to wake up the entire neighbourhood with his voice (not that his vehicle didn't already do that).

So we just kinda said "yeaH we're out here taking some neat pics of the fog" and whatnot, and the guy literally just drove back to where he first emerged out of, and drove past us again so that we could take a second round of photos.

He didn't come back the second time, and then Mia and I went back home unscathed. Jasmine was in my room doing homework or something that whole time, and then I told her the story of what had just happened.
