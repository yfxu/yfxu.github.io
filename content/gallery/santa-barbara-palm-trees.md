Honestly this is kinda just a filler photo to put in the gallery to make myself seem more well-travelled ! aHA !

This photo was taken on a short trip with my girlfriend when we visited her Dad in Los Angeles. We spent 2 days in Santa Barbara, and it was the first time in many years that I'd been to a token California beach.

It was hot and humid, and neither my girlfriend nor I were able to think with more than six combined brain cells because we were both physically and mentally melting in real life!
