This photo was taken sometime during golden hour on Yokohama's (world famous?) Cosmo Clock ferris wheel. It was one of the last few things Jasmine and I had on our itinerary on our Yokohama day trip. I cannot express how utterly magical that feeling is when you're sitting at the top of the ride, and time feels like it freezes for a moment. The sky isn't completely clear, but the golden sunbeams ends up painting pastel pink streaks along the edges of the light blue clouds. Cotton candy clouds...

You're sitting up high, even taller than the office skyscrapers blanketing Yokohama's landscape. The sounds from all the traffic fades out, the chatter of the people in line for the ride fade out, and the small details of everyday life on the ground get tinier and tinier until they too fade out.
