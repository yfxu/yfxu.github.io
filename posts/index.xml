It&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly emotional event or anything, but actually making the decision to bring the site offline has given me the opportunity to reflect in ways I otherwise would not have.
In this post, I want to talk about why I decommissioned osulist, and what I learned throughout the app&amp;rsquo;s lifetime&amp;ndash;from inception until end.
Why I shut it down TL;DR:</description></item><item><title>PSA on Misleading Google Search Featured Snippets</title><link>/posts/google-search-psa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/google-search-psa/</guid><description>When you make a Google search, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance that a result will be contained inside a featured snippet. This is what it looks like:
Featured snippets are supposed to make it easier for people to find key information relevant to their search, but the system isn&amp;rsquo;t always perfect. In fact, the screenshot above shows misleading results.
So whenever you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a quick fact, as tempting as it may be to accept the first bolded answer that shows up, take the extra minute to carefully verify what you&amp;rsquo;ve been shown.</description></item><item><title>The Chopsticks Pocket</title><link>/posts/the-chopsticks-pocket/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-chopsticks-pocket/</guid><description>In the front pocket of my backpack, there&amp;rsquo;s a little space dedicated to multiple pairs of disposable chopsticks I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up from who-knows-where. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most strangely useful parts of my backpack, and I feel that more people should carry around chopsticks similarly.
In university, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that people are often carrying around food with them. They bring around their dinner leftovers. They bring around chips to accompany their late night study session snacking urges.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing My First PC Build</title><link>/posts/reviewing-my-first-pc-build/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/reviewing-my-first-pc-build/</guid><description>A bit over two years ago, I built my first desktop PC. It was a dream I&amp;rsquo;d had since the elementary and middle school days of watching gaming YouTubers record high quality videos of AAA games at a billion frames per second with a gazillion subscribers and they&amp;rsquo;re super cool and popular and and and and (I was really obsessed with gaming)
Anyways, the main goal with this build was to assemble a computer that would be easy to move around.</description></item><item><title>An Editorial on Gamepedia and Fandom</title><link>/posts/an-editorial-on-gamepedia-and-fandom/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/an-editorial-on-gamepedia-and-fandom/</guid><description>Gamepedia was a wiki hosting site well-known for hosting some of the most popular gaming-related wikis on the web. It was home to many official wikis of popular games like Minecraft and Terraria (and technically still is).
Here&amp;rsquo;s why I liked it:
At its forefront, Gamepedia delivered lots of detailed information, and it prioritized doing that extremely well. It was a simple website I could visit to learn anything about the games I played.</description></item><item><title>On Cybersecurity and Parenting</title><link>/posts/on-cybersecurity-and-parenting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/on-cybersecurity-and-parenting/</guid><description>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to listen in on an online cybersecurity presentation delivered live by Paul Davis. He&amp;rsquo;s both a father and an experienced IT professional who now works as an educator and advocator for online safety, frequently appearing as a guest speaker at schools and on TV.
The virtual speech that I attended was directed towards parents of middle school students, offering insight on what parents should be doing for their kids in our current digital age, and what they can do themselves to enhance their own digital privacy.</description></item><item><title>The Illusion of Disagreement</title><link>/posts/the-illusion-of-disagreement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-illusion-of-disagreement/</guid><description>Earlier today, Jasmine and I were playing a game called &amp;ldquo;Wavelength.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple game where two or more players take turns guessing how much or how little some clue represents a certain quality. Ok maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a bit confusing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:
Player 1 is given two different words: &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;delicious&amp;rdquo;. These two words are placed on a 10-point scale with 1 being disgusting, and 10 being delicious.</description></item><item><title>Things I Wish My Teachers Did Differently</title><link>/posts/things-i-wish-my-teachers-did-differently/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/things-i-wish-my-teachers-did-differently/</guid><description>This post serves as a letter to myself in the future if I ever decide to become a better teacher. ALSO I recognize that I am one individual student with my own learning needs. People have different things they each need to excel!
Teaching the context I wish that teachers placed more emphasis on the context surrounding any arbitrary topics. As a student, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to engage myself with the course content when I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why we&amp;rsquo;re learning it.</description></item><item><title>Conveying Emotion Through Text</title><link>/posts/conveying-emotion-through-text/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 23:32:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/conveying-emotion-through-text/</guid><description>Disclaimer: Please don&amp;rsquo;t take this post too seriously
Do YOU want to spice up your online messaging style??? Well you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place! Here are some tips to make people think you&amp;rsquo;re friggin out of your mind:

Mapping</title><link>/posts/four-years-of-osu-mapping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 11:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/four-years-of-osu-mapping/</guid><description>The Start 2017-01-28 ‣ An - 花柳采 (Karyuusai) About 4 years ago, I published Karyuusai as my first serious attempt at making an osu! beatmap—meaning it was a pretty bad map. It had no structure, poor rhythm choices, and fairly garbage-tier aesthetics. But I kept mapping anyway, and I like to think that I got a little better making beatmaps since. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent so much time on this game, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d document my journey and some of the things I learned over these past 4 years as a tribute of sorts to that beatmap.</description></item><item><title>An Adventure in Building osulist</title><link>/posts/an-adventure-in-building-osulist/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/an-adventure-in-building-osulist/</guid><description>https://osulist.tk/
One of my favorite computer games is osu! (exclamation mark included) It&amp;rsquo;s a free rhythm game where the player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to click a bunch of circles that appear on the screen to the beat of a song. Songs are referred to as &amp;ldquo;beatmaps,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; for short.
Over time, something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a really great way to share multiple beatmaps with your friends. Say you&amp;rsquo;ve found a few beatmaps that you really like, and you want your friend to try playing them.</description></item><item><title>Getting Back Into Blogging</title><link>/posts/getting-back-into-blogging/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 20:48:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/getting-back-into-blogging/</guid><description>Back in early 2016, I created a Tumblr account because God knows why. Aha, actually it&amp;rsquo;s because I sorta wanted to exercise my writing skills somewhere outside of school, and blogging seemed like a cool way to achieve that. Part of me actually enjoyed writing because it was a nice way to sort out some thoughts in my head, and overall, it was just a peaceful experience.
At the time, I thought my posts were pretty cool.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Design</title><link>/posts/thoughts-on-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/thoughts-on-design/</guid><description>Many of my friends are well-invested into various forms of arts, either as hobbyists or professionals. So I hear a lot about the zeitgeist™ of whatever art communities are relevant at the time. As a result, I also start thinking more about art and its value (but usually it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more significant than &amp;ldquo;wohaoh this art looks very cool&amp;rdquo;).
Someone I know, being a part-time UI designer, spread their interest in graphic design over to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
