Aha, actually it&rsquo;s because I sorta wanted to exercise my writing skills somewhere outside of school, and blogging seemed like a cool way to achieve that. Part of me actually enjoyed writing because it was a nice way to sort out some thoughts in my head, and overall, it was just a peaceful experience.</p><p>At the time, I thought my posts were pretty cool. At the time. UNFORTUNATELY, I recently decided to take a look at it again because I guess my brain didn&rsquo;t have enough embarassing childhood memories to deal with??? The posts really aren&rsquo;t that great. They read exactly like they were written by an edgy 15-year old high school student looking for cool ways to express their individuality, because that truly was the reality at the time. I was a cool hipster boy slapping away at my keyboard in my basement bedroom hoping to bump up my English mark by maybe one percent. Maybe I still am that same guy ü§î.</p><p>In total, I&rsquo;d submitted 10 proper blog entries&mldr; over 33 days. Yeah, I stopped blogging after a month. It was pretty tiring thinking of new subjects to write about every one or two days, and maybe that&rsquo;s where I went wrong. A blog really should just be a place to dump some thoughts when you have them. It&rsquo;s not like I had any proper fanbase who actually CARED about what I wrote ;&rsquo;).</p><p>So what the heck am I doing here now? To be honest, I have no idea. Something like a sudden flash of inspiration must&rsquo;ve gone through my head because I&rsquo;m sitting here typing out a bunch of html documents without using a templating engine<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> because GitHub offers FREE static web page hosting. Students love the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; by the way!</p><p>I also justified doing this at 3:00 AM by reminding myself that co-op student employability has dropped to be quite low during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning I&rsquo;m gonna need a bit of extra pizzaz to distinguish myself from other similar candidates.</p><p>Oh and here is the forsaken Tumblr account: <a href=https://notxenon.tumblr.com/>https://notxenon.tumblr.com/</a>. Read with caution, or don&rsquo;t read it at all. The latter might be the better option.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>ok now I&rsquo;m using a templating engine&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div class=section><br><footer class=contain><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>source</a>
