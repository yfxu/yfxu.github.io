// 485 words</span><p>This post serves as a letter to myself in the future if I ever decide to become a better teacher. ALSO I recognize that I am one individual student with my own learning needs. People have different things they each need to excel!</p><h2 id=teaching-the-context>Teaching the context</h2><p>I wish that teachers placed more emphasis on the context surrounding any arbitrary topics. As a student, it&rsquo;s hard to engage myself with the course content when I don&rsquo;t even know <em>why</em> we&rsquo;re learning it. What makes it useful? What problem does it solve?</p><p>And by &ldquo;why,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not referring to understanding the derivation of a formula before using it. I want to know why people came up with the formula to begin with. What made this formula so important that they wanted to teach it to students in school?</p><p>When they&rsquo;re already taking so many other courses, understanding the system in which a piece of knowledge exists can greatly help students mentally organize that information, further contributing to the learning process. I want to be able to associate my course content with its purpose and story, not purely for interest&rsquo;s sake, but also because it actually helps me understand the material better. So many times have I just been faced with a full whiteboard of greek letters and numbers, not understanding a single bit of how we got to that point.</p><p>Of course, this is hard to do with certain ultra-theoretical topics, but even a very far-fetched example of an application of that knowledge would give students a minimum baseline to work off of as they struggle through the muckier details.</p><h2 id=break-up-the-lectures>Break up the lectures</h2><p>In high school, our periods were 80 minutes long, with 10 minutes in between periods. I imagine that this longer period of time was intended to help students reap the benefits of their &ldquo;flow state.&rdquo; Admittedly, this is really helpful during classes that are predominantly work periods.</p><p>This DOESN&rsquo;T work when the whole class is just 80 minutes of straight lecturing (for me at least xd). Especially given that most students will have a few courses they aren&rsquo;t as passionate about, this quickly turns into torture, diminishing the effectiveness of any teaching being delivered. Please give students some dedicated time in-between to stretch, go for a walk, refill their waterbottles, use the washrooms, or anything else.</p><p>Of course, this is just me. Some wizards have the magical ability to maintain their focus for however many hours in a row, but from personal experience, most people need time to reset.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, however, these are only things that may benefit students who learn in the same way that I do. These wishes could very well hinder another student from receiving a similarly quality education, and so I think that teachers should ultimately just ask their students what they prefer&mdash;ideally in an anonymous survey so as to prevent anyone from feeling a pressure to conform.</p></div></div><div id=footer><div class=content><footer><div class=footer-links><span class=lower><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>Source</a></span> &#183;
