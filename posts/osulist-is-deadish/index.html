It&rsquo;s not a particularly emotional event or anything, but actually making the decision to bring the site offline has given me the opportunity to reflect in ways I otherwise would not have.</p><p>In this post, I want to talk about why I decommissioned osulist, and what I learned throughout the app&rsquo;s lifetime&ndash;from inception until end.</p><h2 id=why-i-shut-it-down>Why I shut it down</h2><p>TL;DR:</p><ul><li>No one uses it</li><li>I don&rsquo;t feel like maintaining it</li><li>I don&rsquo;t want to pay for the server</li></ul><p><img src=/imgs/mongodb-network.png alt="Network graph for MongoDB database"></p><p>The image above shows osulist&rsquo;s database network graph from Nov 2021 to Nov 2022. Non-flat sections of the graph represent traffic for almost any of the website&rsquo;s pages&mdash;this is because I haven&rsquo;t implemented any type of caching for fetched database results, so viewing any data at all would require a trip to the MongoDB server. And so, you can see that the site was really not getting used that much.</p><p>Unfortunately, non-existent traffic doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate into non-existent server costs. I was paying on average $6 CAD per month to run the server on a single DigitalOcean droplet. While this is pretty much the cheapest VPS option available for most people, I&rsquo;m still a student with a <em>student&rsquo;s paycheck</em> that&rsquo;s for the most part negative. Additionally, I&rsquo;m trying to take back control of my subscription finances. Spotify, Amazon Prime, and another streaming service all stack up to nearly $20 CAD per month, which still isn&rsquo;t <em>particularly</em> expensive, but my student discount periods are about to run out, so I&rsquo;d like to lighten the blow a little.</p><p>So why did the site not get used much in the first place? For one, I didn&rsquo;t actively try to market it. Besides an initial tweet I posted, most people probably had no idea osulist existed. The few people who did know likely also forgot about it over time because I never posted any announcements when updates were released.</p><p>For another, the site was a bit rudimentary and inefficient. Beatmaps had to be uploaded one at a time, and the UI wasn&rsquo;t particularly well-catered towards the average user. Because you had to manually copy and paste beatmap URLs, playlist creation was insanely inefficient. Only the most zealous of beatmap-sharers would ever bother with creating a substantial playlist. The most commonly-requested feature was osu! collection object sharing, which took a few months until <a href=https://github.com/yfxu/osulist/pull/8>someone else actually implemented and merged</a> that feature.</p><hr><p>Throughout osulist&rsquo;s lifetime, some really nice users actually submitted bug reports, and a friend of mine even found a XSS vulnerability!<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> While a good developer would promptly fix these, I actually found myself dreading having to address these problems. As it turns out, I don&rsquo;t like solving bugs in my free time&mldr;which is kind of a problem if I want to build cool things.</p><h2 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve learnt from this experience that part of building great software is not just initially writing flawless code (it&rsquo;s sorta impossible to anyway), but investing as much time and energy into <strong>maintenance</strong>. In the FOSS world, most people don&rsquo;t use code that isn&rsquo;t maintained, and for good reason: bugs and vulnerabilities will not get patched. This can be particularly dangerous if the software in question deals with sensitive data, which in osulist&rsquo;s case would be OAuth tokens! And even if the software doesn&rsquo;t deal with sensitive data, that doesn&rsquo;t protect users from XSS or similar attacks when any other type of user-input exists.</p><p>If you want people to continue interacting with your code, you need to maintain it: just as you would maintain a property that you rent out to tenants. Otherwise, it falls apart over time.</p><hr><p>Overall, I feel relieved having shut down osulist. It was a nice project to put on my resume while internship hunting halfway through my degree, but the codebase was written quite haphazardly, and I cannot be particularly proud of its quality today.</p><p>I <em>am</em> proud that I made it, however. This was a first-time experience for me in being an open-source project maintainer, and I learned so much about databases, authentication schemes, cybersecurity in general, etc. I can certainly say that this experience has made me a better programmer.</p><p>Another nice outcome from decommissioning osulist is that I have less to think about. Although it sounds a little silly to say that a side project I barely maintained affected my mental state at all, randomly thinking about things like the unresolved bug reports or the six dollar monthly costs introduced many bits of &ldquo;small negativity&rdquo; into my daily life.</p><hr><p>For anyone who still wants to share long &ldquo;playlists&rdquo; of beatmaps, I recommend using <a href=https://osucollector.com/>osu!collector</a>!
This is an alternative collection-sharing app that was coincidentally developed&mdash;partially by one of my friends&mdash;around the same time that osulist was. It&rsquo;s actually very nice to use, and is certainly being maintained more than osulist was. (the existence of this site probably also contributed to osulist&rsquo;s lack of traffic)</p><p>That said, osulist is not <em>dead</em> dead. A year ago I began experimenting with an entire rewrite of osulist, opting for a traditional RDBMS like PostgreSQL over MongoDB, and just with generally cleaner code which would hopefully improve maintainability. I&rsquo;ve also envisioned additional features such as being able to rate mappers or individual beatmaps on a 1-10 scale. The data can be easily aggregated into a view that would show an overall mapper ranking list, just like IMDB does for movies, or MAL does for anime titles. It hasn&rsquo;t quite taken off&mldr; yet.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Thanks Zer0-G ;&rsquo;) <a href=https://github.com/yfxu/osulist/pull/9>https://github.com/yfxu/osulist/pull/9</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div class=section><br><footer class=contain><a href=https://github.com/yfxu/yfxu.github.io>source</a>
