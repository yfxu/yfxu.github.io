Songs are referred to as &ldquo;beatmaps,&rdquo; or &ldquo;maps&rdquo; for short.</p><p>Over time, something I&rsquo;ve noticed is that there isn&rsquo;t a really great way to share multiple beatmaps with your friends. Say you&rsquo;ve found a few beatmaps that you really like, and you want your friend to try playing them. For every single beatmap you want to share, you&rsquo;d have to send them one unique URLâ€”an online link to that beatmap.</p><p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve sent at least 50 links at a time. While I do really love this game and enjoy sharing beatmaps that I enjoy, this repeated action does get kind of inefficient. It&rsquo;s also not the most elegant way to share songs since a URL doesn&rsquo;t convey a beatmap&rsquo;s title, artist name, BPM, etc.</p><p>So, I decided to do something even more inefficient: start working on a new side project.</p><h2 id=cue-osulist>Cue osulist</h2><p>osulist would be a CRUD application that at a minimum supports OAuth2 logins with a user&rsquo;s osu! account, creation of beatmap playlists, and the ability to edit, remove, and add individual beatmaps to those playlists. Because I&rsquo;d developed a different web app with Flask at a previous co-op, I decided to continue with Flask for this new application. Playlists would be saved as JSON documents in a MongoDB Atlas. The website would be served on a cheap DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet.</p><p>The first mistake I made was using MongoDB without thinking about it first. The reason I&rsquo;d chosen to use it was because a friend of mine used it for a Discord bot he was developing. Maybe I&rsquo;m just an excited monkey that sees cool things and instantly tries to touch it.</p><p>What ended up happening is that the database structure was ill-suited for keeping track of individual beatmap data, on top of associating each beatmap with its respective playlist. This resulted in a database that was more fragmented and hard to manage, and it might&rsquo;ve also performed slower as a result. While it is possible to implement relational data in MongoDB, it would&rsquo;ve made more sense to just use a traditional RDMS from the start. Oh well.</p><p>My second mistake was getting addicted.</p><p>I spent multiple hours of my day developing the site, coding whenever I had the chance in-between online lectures, and also late into the night. I often started sleeping around 3 to 4AM. I truly did have a lot of fun developing osulist, though. Never having worked on a side project of this scale before, it was really cool to see my own idea finally taking shape after being built from nothing.</p><h2 id=motivation>Motivation</h2><p>The main side-effect of sinking so much time into this side project, however, is that I&rsquo;ve lost all my steam now. I was able to push out an MVP before 2021, but now there are ideas I have that will sit around for a while because I don&rsquo;t have any more motivation to implement them. There are a few bugs I&rsquo;ve found, but I&rsquo;ve relegated them to be bug-fix tasks for the future. Coding that much in such a short period of time takes a toll on the brain. It wasn&rsquo;t just coding, either. I had to read lots of documentation, learn new concepts, and spend time designing for aesthetics.</p><p>Overall, this was still a great experience, however. Working on osulist helped me learn about databases, setting up a VPS, and web security concepts, among other things. I hope that I&rsquo;ll find a drive to work on it again in the future as I do think osulist is a very useful web app, so of course I&rsquo;d like to see it be a better piece of software.</p><p>Shoutouts to Mister <a href=https://mzhang.io/>IOException</a> for helping me a lot along the way. I would&rsquo;ve been super lost without your help xd</p></div></div><br><br><div class=content><footer><div class=footer-links><span class=lower><a href=mailto:yifei@yfxu.net>Email</a></span> &#183;
