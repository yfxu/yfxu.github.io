Well you&rsquo;ve come to the right place! Here are some tips to make people think you&rsquo;re friggin out of your mind:</p><h3 id=random-capitalization>RAnDom CapiTALiZatIon</h3><p>Useful when mocking something or just wanting to sound very over-the-top for any reason. Capitalization can also indicate where you&rsquo;d normally change your tone/pitch to emphasize things.</p><blockquote><p>A: Holy shit man did you see Cookiezi&rsquo;s choke on Blue Zenith???<br>B: yea bro wHAT teh FUcK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: <em>sets a really cracked osu! score</em><br>B: yeAH OK buddy</p></blockquote><h3 id=ascii-emotes>ascii emotes</h3><p>Facial expression is actually a pretty important tool to help deliver a certain feeling to in-person speech. You can replicate the effect online too!!! You can also use actual emotes but a lot of them kinda suckkkkk</p><blockquote><p>A: Ay yo man how&rsquo;d you do on the <strong>ECE 240 - Electronic Circuits 1</strong> final?<br>B: ;&rsquo;)<br>A: yo !!saMe!! I think I might be fucked XDDDDDDD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Hey man you wanna shut the fuck up :^)<br>B: a</p></blockquote><p>My personal favorite is ;-; because you can add more semicolons to convey eVen mORe SAdness!!!</p><blockquote><p>A: ;-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</p></blockquote><p>Bonus points if you use slightly more uncommon custom emotes</p><blockquote><p>A: :<br>A: 　D &lt;&ndash; (multi-line happy face to show stretched mouth or some shit idk)<br>B: ;0<br>A: >:]<br>B: o.e</p></blockquote><h3 id=make-use-of-periods>make use of periods</h3><p>Ok so usually no one ever types full sentences with proper punctuation, but adding a full stop can give your messages some bonus effect (idk what effect but there&rsquo;s an effect)</p><blockquote><p>A: <em>says something kinda sus</em><br>B: Bro.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: fucked ur mom last night hahahaha<br>B: .</p></blockquote><p>This one can feel kinda cold tho, so use it responsibly xDxxDXxDXDd</p><h3 id=write-like-youd-speak-irl>write like you&rsquo;d speak irl</h3><p>When you have time to think about what you want to write/type, it often ends up sounding a bit more formal, which can come off a bit overly-serious and KinDA Kill The VIBE. If you say &ldquo;like&rdquo; a lot in real life, just slap em&rsquo; in your messages whenever you&rsquo;re feelin it</p><blockquote><p>A: You think I&rsquo;m ready for this interview?<br>B: yea I mean prolly<br>B: just don&rsquo;t like<br>B: make derogatory comments or some shit aHA</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: bro how do I win on tinder<br>B: you uhhhhhhhhh<br>B: don&rsquo;t be ugly XDDDD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: hiwhuiewnhsdijfhaie<br>B: you aight man?</p></blockquote><h3 id=abuse-markdown>abuse <em><strong>MARKDOWN</strong></em></h3><p>Most messaging platforms nowadays have basic markdown support. You should uhhhhhh use markdown</p><blockquote><p>A: yo<br>A: how was    <em>the date</em><br>B: uhHHh Kinda <strong>sH</strong>iT ngl</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-holy-question-mark>the holy question mark</h3><p>Slap your friends with the best punctuation mark to have ever existed.</p><blockquote><p>A: yo guys how do I recover from a 100k loss?<br>B: ?????????</p></blockquote><p>Better yet, hit em with the infamous ｆｕｌｌ－ｗｉｄｔｈ　ｑｕｅｓｔｉｏｎ　ｍａｒｋ</p><blockquote><p>A: <em>says something sus again</em><br>B: ？</p></blockquote><p>In real life, people often say things in a way that sounds like they&rsquo;re unsure. You can kinda replicate this effect by surrounding your words with question marks</p><blockquote><p>A: Do you remember what the teacher said about mitochondria?<br>B: I ?think? he said something about how it&rsquo;s the powerhouse of the cell</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: do you really think she&rsquo;d give part marks for that tho<br>B: I mean ?Probably?? I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s pretty generous with marks</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Yo dude, is Chicago a state, city, country, continent, or village?<br>B: shit uhhh, I think it&rsquo;s a ??state??</p></blockquote><h3 id=other-punctuation>other punctuation</h3><p>just don&rsquo;t use punctuation in the ways they were taught to be used in school</p><blockquote><p>A: broo&mldr;. your match against them was brutal<br>B: yea I think I&rsquo;m just gonna !!END!! myself rn XDDDDD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: bro you nee.d to,<br>A: slo w 　&lsquo;down<br>B: no fuck u]</p></blockquote><p>This gets really chaotic really quickly tho, and people might think you&rsquo;re actually weird, which is not necessarily a bad thing</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>I wrote all this shit because I was talking with someone recently about texting styles. As shallow and judgmental as this may sound, it can <em>sometimes</em> feel pretty bad talking to someone who writes everything in lowercase without adding any extra colour to their messages. It might come off as if they&rsquo;re being cold/don&rsquo;t care, especially if you&rsquo;ve never met them in person, and don&rsquo;t know their speech mannerisms. If you&rsquo;re trying to reject someone though, then don&rsquo;t do anything in this guide I guess aHA.</p><p>OF COURSE, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that people who type in 100% lowercase without emotes are boring/uninteresting people irl. The fact of the matter is, text is not the same as speech. They&rsquo;re used in different situations for different purposes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s really hard to capture emotion in just plain text, but I think it&rsquo;s worth putting in a bit of extra effort to sound funny or ridiculous. For a lot of people, it&rsquo;s funny, and that can help improve their day a bit xd (tho some people might find it pretty annoying)</p><p>I very much enjoyed making up these fake conversations between arbitrary individuals A and B. Hope they continue to do great things in their lives!!</p></article><hr><footer><a href>source</a>
